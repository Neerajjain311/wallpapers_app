# Pixel Perfect (Wallpapers App)

Pixel perfect is a simple, easy to use, refreshing wallpaper app built using **Flutter** and **Pexels API** which allows users to exxplore, search and download beautiful wallpapers (updated in regular intervals). 

## Backdrop

Was bored and fed up of using existing wallpapers/backgrounds app filled with ads, so made an app to explore Flutter and create a simple, yet *fully functional* wallpapers app alongwith download (save in gallery) functionality.

## Features

- [x] Download Image (save to gallery)
- [x] Curated list of wallpapers
